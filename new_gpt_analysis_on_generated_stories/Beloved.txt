Overall Analysis: 
This book seems to present a mostly neutral or positive view of each category. There is an interesting inclusion of environmentalism across multiple groups, which might suggest an environmentalist theme. The descriptions do not seem overtly discriminatory, which could point to an attempt at equal representation. However, the labeling itself (focusing on gender, race, and economic status) might enforce certain social categorizations. Attitude towards them seems positive or neutral, based on descriptor words.
