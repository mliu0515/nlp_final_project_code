Overall Analysis: The descriptions are largely positive across all categories, which suggests the source material is generally optimistic or looks favorably upon its subjects. However, there are certain inherent societal biases hinted. Older age seems to have negative connotations in descriptions of women and the poor. The poor are also described as "ancient", suggesting they are out of touch or irrelevant. Finally, there is slight bias in words used to describe white (agreeable words) and non-white (dynamic words), perhaps reflecting a bias towards stability and convention in white characters and vibrancy, drama in non-white characters.
