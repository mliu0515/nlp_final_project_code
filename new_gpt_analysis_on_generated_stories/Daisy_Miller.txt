Overall Analysis: The book's descriptors largely carry positive connotations across all character categories. There appears to be a bias toward positivity in descriptions - males are strong, whites are wealthy, rich are vigil, etc. Yet, slight negative tones can be traced in descriptions for women and poor - framing women as quiet and the poor as rigid/different. Thus, some subtle biases are present. The book generally maintains a positive sentiment with few exceptions.
