Overall Analysis: This work represents a range of stereotypes tied to societal roles (men, women), racial identity (white, non-white), and social class (rich, poor). Men and women have both positive and negative descriptors, reflecting a balance. However, a clear bias is visible in descriptors for white and non-white individuals, with the former being heavily positive and the latter containing notably negative connotations. The portrayal of rich and poor also indicates a bias with contrasting positive and negative connotations. 

Overall Sentiment: The list seems fairly balanced with a mix of positive and negative words, but the specific negative connotations associated with certain groups reflect ingrained societal biases.
