Overall Analysis: The descriptors used in the book convey the complexity and multidimensionality of each category. However, there's an evident bias towards complexity in the portrayal of males, females, and white characters.

The overall sentiment of the text leans to the negative and neutral to some degree, as there is a significant prevalence of negatively connotative words across all categories, and very few positively charged ones for the categories like rich and poor. This could imply a rather grim or realistic portrayal of the characters in the book.
