Overall Analysis: The depiction of these categories is largely influenced by pre-existing stereotypes and social biases. Men and women are each associated with similar descriptors, which suggests a potential attempt at gender equality. However, class depictions are bias as the rich are depicted more positively than the poor, bolstering classist stereotypes. Racial biases exist as well since non-white descriptors, although mostly positive, include negative ones like "pruned" and "oleaginous". Thus, the work seems to contain elements of classism and a hint of racism. 

The overall sentiment analysis of the list indicates more negative words than positive ones. This might suggest a more pessimistic or realistic view of the characters and the social conditions they represent.
