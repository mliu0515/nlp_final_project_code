Female descriptors hold more negative connotations and perhaps imply seclusion or oddness. Non-white descriptors contain possible pejorative elements. The rich are described as mostly positive and the poor are surprisingly not skewed largely negatively. The themes of darkness, emptiness, and dustiness appear across all categories in a potentially negative light. 

Sentiment Analysis: Given the mix of positive and negative descriptors across all categories, the overall sentiment analysis leans neither strongly toward the positive nor the negative but remains somewhat balanced. However, the consistent negative elements suggest a generally bleak or somber undertone throughout the descriptors.
