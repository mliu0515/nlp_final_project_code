Overall Analysis: The list of descriptors indicates substantial bias favoring males, white persons, and the rich. While there are efforts to describe all groups in a nuanced and holistic way, the negative words used reveal unaddressed biases, particularly towards women, non-white individuals and the poor. This speaks to the need for more mindful language use to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes. The overall sentiment across categories is mixed - with an almost equal balance of positive and negative words used.
