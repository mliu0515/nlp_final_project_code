Overall Analysis: There seem to be apparent biases present in these descriptors. It seems the book displays layered preconceptions about men, women, whites, non-whites, the rich, and the poor. Social classes are also put into positive or negative spotlights. The descriptors used connote that each category is stereotyped, indicating a bias - perhaps unconscious - on the part of the author. Overall, the language used seems more negative than positive.
