Overall Analysis: Broadly speaking, the representation of different groups in the analysed text seems to present an nuanced image, with both positive and negative traits attributed to each group. However, one could argue that there's a significant amount of racial bias at play as attributes for white and non-white characters seem to be comparatively more divided. The white characters are primarily described using richer and older words while non-white figures are referred to with more simplified and youthful language. The portrayal of rich and poor individuals seems to be rather balanced with both positive and negative characteristics assigned almost equally.
