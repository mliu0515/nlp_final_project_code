Overall Analysis: The book seems to propagate a social bias favoring maleness, whiteness, and richness given the overwhelmingly positive connotations of the descriptors used. However, it also subtly intertwines negative connotations for the female, non-white, and poor categories. The sentiment analysis suggests a general favoritism and idealization of the 'male, white and rich', whereas the 'female, non-white and poor' categories are subjected to more limitations and negative experiences.
