Overall Analysis: This book appears to contain social biases favouring "white" and "rich" characters, as they are mostly described with positive words. On gender terms, males and females are described with a mix of positive and negative words. Non-white descriptors contain both positive and negative terms, showing more balanced representation. The use of ‘brown’ as a negative descriptor appears to have a racial tone. In general, most categories contain a mix of positive and negative descriptions, which could be indicative of a nuanced approach to characterization, but some bias seems evident.
