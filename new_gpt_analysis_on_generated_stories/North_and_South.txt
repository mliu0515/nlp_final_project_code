Overall Analysis: In general, this work seems to contain some stereotypes by categorizing social aspects into ‘white’, 'non-white', ‘rich’, 'poor', 'male', 'female', however, these descriptions are primarily positive, with fewer negative words being used. As for sentiments, it's mainly positive across the categories with only a handful of negative connotations. This implies a generally positive sentiment within the book. However, the use of “haughty” for rich and “wounded” for poor may reflect some social biases in the work. The use of similar descriptors across different categories suggests a less contrastive character presentation.
