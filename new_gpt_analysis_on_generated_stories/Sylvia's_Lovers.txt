Overall Analysis: The work appears to portray both men and women in positive lights, with an emphasis on their strengths, complexities, and resources. However, non-white characters seem slightly more marginalized. Wealth is viewed positively, and poverty is recognized for its struggles while still acknowledging the complexity and depth of the poor's experience. The sentiment overall is largely positive across all categories. However, there is a noticeable bias in favor of wealth and white characters, as seen in the more positive descriptors used for these groups, whereas a few negative connotations are found when describing males, non-whites, and the poor.
