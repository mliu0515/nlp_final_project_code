Overall Analysis: The collected descriptors present more positive than negative connotations in each category. However, there are subtle social biases prevalent in the descriptions, for instance, the males are often described as old and narrow, and females as insurmountable and ruthless. The non-white category using 'unwritten' and the poor described as predictable hints at some ingrained stereotypes. Rich people being described as 'hidden' and 'devoid' could indicate a secretive or absence-centered framing. Hence, while the overall sentiment is positive, biases and stereotypes do subsist.
