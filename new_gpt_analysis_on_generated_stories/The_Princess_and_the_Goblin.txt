Overall Analysis: The book's descriptors suggest a mixture of positive and negative connotations across all categories, indicating complex portrayals. Still, some potential biases are evident, such as associating fear with the poor and invisibility with non-white and rich characters. There is also a notable power dynamic, with words like "high", "great", and "grand" often linked to men, the rich, and white characters. 

Overwhelmingly, the descriptors are positive rather than negative, suggesting a generally favourable depiction of the characters and situations in the book. However, the negative words are significant and recurring across categories - such as "fearful", "invisible", and "hardiest", indicating prevalent themes of fear, invisibility, and struggle.
