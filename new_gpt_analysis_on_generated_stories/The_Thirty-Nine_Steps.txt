Overall Analysis: The descriptors used suggest biases both in terms of gender and race: men and white people receive more positive descriptors compared to women and non-white individuals respectively. As for wealth, the book seems to present a more balanced depiction of both the rich and poor. However, the frequent use of "free-spirited", "elegant" and "curious" across categories may suggest a general positive sentiment in the book.
