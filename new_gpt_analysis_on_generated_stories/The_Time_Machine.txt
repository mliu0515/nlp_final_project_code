The terms used for males and whites are mixed, with both positive and negative connotations, but the descriptors for non-whites have a sense of mystery, though not completely negative. Rich descriptors suggest wealth being related with distance and disinterest. Poor descriptors suggest resilience or survivalism. It's important to read these words in context to fully understand the author's intended meaning.

Sentiment Analysis: The overall sentiment seems to be a blend of positive, negative, and neutral, but leans more towards a negative or bleak imagery due to words such as 'foggy', 'faded', and 'extinct'.
