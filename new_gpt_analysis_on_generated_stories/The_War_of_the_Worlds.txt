Overall Analysis: The work hosts an array of descriptors across different categories that lean towards both positive and negative sentiments. Existential states, intellectual capabilities, and eccentricities are commonly attributed to all categories, indicating a common understanding of human complexities. However, social biases are noticeable. For example, non-whites are marked with strange, bizarre descriptors, hinting at exoticization, while the poor are pinned with words like 'annexed' and 'worse'. Males and the rich are attributed with words connoting power and ambition. Such biases reveal a societal stereotyping tendency, and reinforce rather than challenge mainstream prejudices.
